## Skin Cancer Detection

**Abstract**

Skin cancer encompasses over 200 different forms, with melanoma being the deadliest. The diagnostic process for melanoma begins with clinical screening, followed by dermoscopic analysis and histopathological examination. Early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. Initial diagnosis involves a visual examination of the affected skin area, where dermatologists capture dermatoscopic images using high-speed cameras. These images yield an accuracy of 65-80% in melanoma diagnosis without additional technical support. With further examination by specialists, the accuracy improves to 75-84%. This project aims to develop an automated classification system using image processing techniques to classify skin cancer based on images of skin lesions.

**Dataset**

The dataset comprises 2,357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). The images are categorized according to ISIC classifications and evenly distributed across subsets.

**CNN Architecture**

- **Rescaling Layer**: Rescales input from the [0, 255] range to the [0, 1] range.

- **Convolutional Layer**: Applies convolution operations to the input, reducing image size while consolidating information into single pixels.

- **Pooling Layer**: Reduces dimensions of feature maps, decreasing the number of parameters and computational load. It summarizes features from regions of the feature map generated by convolution layers.

- **Dropout Layer**: Randomly sets input units to 0 at a specified frequency during training to prevent overfitting.

- **Flatten Layer**: Converts data into a 1-dimensional array for input into the next layer, creating a long feature vector from the output of convolutional layers.

- **Dense Layer**: A fully connected layer where each neuron receives input from all neurons in the previous layer.

- **Activation Function (ReLU)**: The rectified linear activation function outputs the input directly if positive; otherwise, it outputs zero, addressing the vanishing gradient problem and enhancing learning speed.

- **Activation Function (Softmax)**: Used in the output layer to predict a multinomial probability distribution, ensuring output probabilities range from 0 to 1, with their sum equal to one.
